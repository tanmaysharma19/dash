## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data science consultancy firm
 
Target audience: UN, WHO, government policymakers and project administrators, international aid agencies, researchers and public health professionals
 
Obesity has been an increasing medical concern across the world in the 21st century. It is a medical precursor to diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, high blood pressure and certain types of cancers. With global proclivity towards stressful and fast paced lives and an unprecedented consumption of processed foods, obesity as a challenge has been garnering the attention of global health agencies.

We are a data science consultancy firm that specializes in global health and behavior. We propose to build a dashboard to present the historical trends of obesity over the last few decades across the different countries of the world. This unified view would help policy makers and researchers to identify the regions that warrant the most aid and elucidate upon some of the key factors driving the rise of obesity. Our dashboard aims to collate different visualizations that would help a policy maker or public health professional to better plan their target audience, risk groups, aid budgets and resources vis-à-vis the obesity trends of the different countries.
